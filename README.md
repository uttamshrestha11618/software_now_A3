The application presented in this project is a Tkinter-based GUI application written as an assignment in HIT137 Assignment 3. It combines two free Hugging Face AI models of different types, DistilGPT-2, to generate a text and the Vision Transformer (ViT Base) to classify an image. The user has the option to add either text or images, choose the right model using a dropdown menu and see the processed output in the interface. The program illustrates some important concepts of object-oriented programing like encapsulation (through private attributes), polymorphism and method availability (there are different run() methods in all the model types), multiple inheritance (UI class design), and decorators (logging and timing). There are also sections in the interface where the explanations of where these OOP principles were implemented and the short descriptions of the models based on AI are listed. The code is divided into several files (main.py, gui.py, models.py, and utils.py) to be more readable and maintainable. Both text generation and image classification outputs are shown as screen shots to show functionality and a github_link.txt file is included so as to access the public repository.
